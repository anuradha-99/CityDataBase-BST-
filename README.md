# CityDataBase-BST
Implement a city database using a Binary Search Tree (BST) to store the database records.
Each database record contains the name of the city (a string of arbitrary length) and the coordinates of the
city expressed as double values of latitude and longitude coordinates in Decimal Degrees type.
The BST should be organized by city name.
It has following methods
-> Insert data
-> Delete data by name
-> Search by name
-> Print city records in descending order
-> Print all cities within a given distance of a specified point
